# Catalog of wide sep lensed QSO candidates dual QSO from CatNorth

Outcomes of this project comprise two distinct components: (1) lensed quasar (QSO) candidates, and (2) dual QSO systems selected based on velocity differences <2000 km/s and projected separations <100 kpc.

Each component in this GitHub repository contains:

1‌.Data tables‌ with column descriptions provided in the accompanying manuscript

2‌.Image sets‌ systematically organized as follows (left to right in each panel):

Optical-band spectra (when available);

Fundamental parameter summary of the target;

DESI Legacy Survey imaging;

DESI Legacy Survey residual;

Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) archival images.
